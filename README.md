# Plant-Disease-Classification-INT-427
 This study addresses the classification of plant leaf diseases by implementing deep learning models such as CNN and its architectures VGG16 and VGG19 using transfer learning approach along with machine learning algorithms to build a robust model in classifying the leaf diseases to generate high precision levels with minimum system configuration, thus enables to seek the answers to questions like “To what extent CNN along with transfer learning technique effective in identifying and classifying diseases in leaf of plants?”.
 To the best of my understanding, deep learning models along with eXtreme Gradient Boosting and traditional models like Support Vector Machine and Random Forest are the models still to be addressed jointly and therefore might appear to be of great benefit to the farmers in classifying the plant leaf diseases if favorable results acquired. Objectives of this study includes:
